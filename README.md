# BitsreamFtp
A simple ftp client

This started as a basic practice project but the code is really clean and clear, the ftp commands are all organized into methods so this can easily become a valid c++ ftp protocal implimentation with minimal effort.

If interested  just fork it, impliment the reamining ftp commands into methods ect then send me a merge request.
